## Supplementary movies

#### Movie S1 - Pouzet2024_NetworksPannel_3x5_GEN0-2000_FULL.mp4
Evolution of networks from generation 1 to 2,000, adapting to two successive environments, 
Starting from three initial conditions and leading to three distinct topologies. After adaptation to the first environment (with genes 1 to 5 undergoing selection for a random expression optimum, while genes 6 to 10 evolved freely), an environmental shift occurs at generation 1000 (gene expression optima for two genes are altered), leading to a 0.5 fitness drop. Five networks are displayed for each of the three topologies examined in this study. The first (left) column includes networks used as representative examples in Figure 1. Each gene is color-coded, with edge colors indicating the regulatory gene: solid edges represent activation, and dashed edges represent repression. Node size reflects gene activity ("coding" value), and edge width represents the total strength of regulation.


#### Movie S2 - Pouzet2024_NetworksPannel_3x5_GEN0-0500_slow.mp4
Zoomed-in, slower version of the movie S1 from generation 1 to 500. 
It shows the adaptation to the first environment, detailing the emergence of different topologies and their associated timings. These are the same images as in the previous movie S1, with the same corresponding legend.
